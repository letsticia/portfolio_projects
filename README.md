## üíª Software Development Projects

| Project Link | Completion Status | Tools | Description | Patent |
|--------------|------------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| [üß± Crack It](https://github.com/cilab-ufersa/crack_detection_app) | COMPLETE (Aug, 2024) | Python, Streamlit, OpenCV, TensorFlow | This app uses a deep learning model to detect cracks in images of concrete surfaces. Users can upload an image or take a picture from your camera to see the model in action. It will segment the image to highlight the cracks and classify the image as containing a crack or not. Users can also download a report of the results. Additionally, Users can analyze the crack by selecting two points on the image. The app will calculate the line equation that passes through the points and the angle of the line with the x-axis. This can be useful to determine the orientation of the crack. | BR5120240030-8 |
| [‚ûó Analytic Geometry Calculator](https://github.com/letsticia/HackathonGA/tree/main) | COMPLETE (Apr, 2024) | Python, Streamlit, Matplotlib | The main objective of this project is to develop a web application that assists in teaching and learning Analytical Geometry for high school students. The application, implemented using Python and Streamlit, provides tools to simplify calculations related to points, lines, and circles within Analytical Geometry. Users can interact with the app through a user-friendly interface, selecting specific functionalities to perform the desired computations. The project is designed to make Analytical Geometry concepts more accessible and practical for students. | -- |
| [ü§Ω‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Water Park System](https://github.com/classroom-ufersa/SistemaParqueAquatico) | COMPLETE (Apr, 2024) | Python, Streamlit | The Water Park System project is a system designed to manage a water park, developed using both Python and C programming languages. It was created as part of the Algorithms and Data Structures I class and enables the management of pools and clients in a water park. The system provides various functionalities, including adding, removing, and listing pools, managing bathers in each pool, and handling client data such as adding new clients, removing them, editing their information, and searching by name. In Python, the system utilizes the Streamlit library to create a graphical interface, while the C implementation employs linked lists for efficient data management. | -- |
| [üññ LIBRAS Sign-to-text AI](https://github.com/cilab-ufersa/libras44) | COMPLETE (Feb, 2025) | Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Scikit-learn | LIBRAS44 is a system for recognizing Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS) signs that uses computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques to identify and translate signs in real-time into text and voice. *Funded by CNPQ*.| BR512025000474-5 |

## üèÖ Achievements

- **2024**: [1st place in the Hackathon of the 1st ECOP-SABI√Å](https://assecom.ufersa.edu.br/2024/09/10/ufersa-em-pau-dos-ferros-premia-participantes-do-i-hackathon-ecop-sabia/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaaCE0hPj7qpf3gluGRdc4vcBYJxVTPufdVBozzPKBZUXfvT50ot6U86v9U_aem_o84YHzEvE-MFfPHoSRDqig) (Encontro de Computa√ß√£o do Oeste Potiguar) with the project "CultivApp" ‚Äì a mobile application that allows family farmers to connect with the local market and sell their products, as well as learn how to cultivate their plants with lessons from students of the Agroecology course.

- **2024**: [Approved as GitHub Campus Expert](https://githubcampus.expert/letsticia/). This program supports student leaders who strive to build diverse and inclusive spaces to learn skills, share experiences, and build projects together. GitHub Campus Experts lead conferences, meetups, and hackathons, both online and in person, and maintain open-source projects.
